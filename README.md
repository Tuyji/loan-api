# Loan API - Spring Boot Application

## Overview
The Loan API is a Spring Boot application designed for managing loans in a banking system. It provides functionality to create loans, list loans for customers, retrieve installment details, and process loan payments. The application is secured using Spring Security with role-based access control for ADMIN and CUSTOMER users.
